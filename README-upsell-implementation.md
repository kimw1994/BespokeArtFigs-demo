## Features

### 1. Cart Template (cart.liquid)
- Responsive cart page layout
- Gift wrapping options with custom message field
- Integration with upsell section
- AJAX-enabled cart updates
- Form validations
- Consistent styling with the rest of the theme

### 2. Upsell Section (upsell.liquid)

- 'Add to Cart' button with AJAX functionality
- 'Add to Wishlist' button with notification

## How It Works

1. **Related Products**: The upsell section automatically displays products related to the first item in the cart.

2. **Occasion Tagging**: Products are tagged based on their tags (wedding, birthday, anniversary) and displayed with corresponding labels.

3. **Scarcity Alerts**: Limited edition products with 5 or fewer items in inventory display a scarcity alert.

4. **Gift Wrapping**: Customers can add gift wrapping and a custom message at checkout.

5. **AJAX Updates**: All cart updates happen seamlessly without refreshing the page.

## Customization

1. **Styling**: Modify the CSS in each file to match your store's branding.

2. **Text Content**: Update the translation keys in the Liquid code to customize the text displayed.

3. **Product Recommendations**: The related products are automatically pulled from Shopify's related products feature. You can adjust the limit in the code (currently set to 4).

4. **Scarcity Threshold**: Change the inventory quantity threshold for scarcity alerts (currently set to 5).

## Maintenance

1. Keep the code up to date with any changes to Shopify's API.

2. Test the functionality after any theme updates.

3. Monitor performance to ensure AJAX requests are not causing delays.

4. Update the lifestyle tips regularly to keep them relevant.
